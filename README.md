# react-tui

A [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) custom renderer for the terminal.

This renderer is in early development phase ans should be considered as experimental. It will only work withReact's latest version (`~18.0.2`, using Fiber).

It's inspired by [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed)/[neo-blessed](https://github.com/embarklabs/neo-blessed) and [react-blessed](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/react-blessed) but a complete own, new implementation using typescript. It does not use the blessed or neo-blessed library at all.
